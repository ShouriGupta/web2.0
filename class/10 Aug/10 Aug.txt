Part 1:
------

    Asynchronous calls examples:
        XHR
        Hidden frames
        img loading (say we want to obtain a boolean result)
            onload & onerror (via status code)
            return differently sized images based on what happens
                eg. 1x1 or 1x2
                onblur, create an image dynamically and make request
                point the src to a php script
                body will have the image
                    if we want to return a string, add it within the <head> tag - maybe as a cookie
            * We can make cross domain calls! (unlike frames)
            -ves:
                ##########
                Won't work if images are disabled
                History can't be maintained

    PHP GD configuration
        Go to php_directory/ext/
        Look for a file called php_gd2.dll
        If present,
            Go to php.ini
            Look for the line and uncomment it
                ;extension=php_gd2.dll -> extension=php_gd2.dll

Part 2:
------

XHR -> XMLHttpRequest
    readyState          -> 0 to 4
        TODO: fill###
        0 -
        1 - Opened successfully
        2 - Send
        3 -
        4 -
    status              -> 200, 400, 500 etc
    onreadystatechange  ->

    responseText
    responseXML
    response        (binary data)

Create the XHR object
Register function (onreadystatechange)
If POST,
    setRequestHeader("application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
open("METHOD", url, async(true/false))  (readyState=1)
    Only allows asynchronous requests
